# STATS220

This repository is all about my work for stats220. I will try to demonstrate my understanding about the course material as much as I can.

### Module 1: Creating HTML by combining modern technologies.

I have learnt some **basic markdown syntaxes** from the lecture:

*  **Headers**
* **Text formatting**
* **Lists/Bullet points**
* **Links/images**

#### *Headers*

There are *different levels of headers*:
1. *Level 1 header -- indicated by # and a space(# )*
2. *Level 2 header -- smaller, indicated by ## and a space(## )*
3. *Level 3 header -- smaller than level 2 header, indicated by ### and a space(### )*

#### *Text formatting*

1. **Bold** -- Quoting the texts that you want to make it bold by **.
2. *Italic* -- Quoting the texts that you want to make it italic by *.
3. `Inline code` -- Quoting the text that you want to make it inline code by `.

#### *Links/Images*

1. **Hyperlink** -- The format for hyperlink is writting some clickable text inside [] and then the URL in a () after the square brackets.
2. **Image** -- The format for Image is ! followed by [] with some alternative texts for the image and then the URL in a ().
